# Matrix multiplication and inverse
The goal of this small project was to learn the basics about matrices multiplication and inversion and how to implement this in Python code. The importance of matrix inversion as a technique lies in the fact that it can help us solve these simultaneous linear equations. It is a crucial method in statistics and machine learning.
